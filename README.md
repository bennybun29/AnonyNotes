This project's purpose was to apply all the learnings I've had on this specific semester. It contains simple HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript features such as: Buttons,
Text Area, Navigation and Ratings. Appearance-wise, it is in black because it represents the brand/website name which is called AnonyNotes. This was just a simple project. What this output
lacks is a database or the backend.
