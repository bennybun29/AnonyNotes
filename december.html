                        called <b>"4 Clues 1 Word"</b> and right now there's not much schoolworks for me
                        to do. I am waiting for the other subjects <i>(Specially the major subjects)</i> 
                        but for some reason I got a <b>60</b> for my GEN 002 grade!? I don't even know if I deserved that tbh.
                        I hope my instructor see my message ASAP so that I can sleep for the rest of the night. Argh,
                        this is stressing me out so badle. I just also hope that my major subjects would be considerate.<br/>
